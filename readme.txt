Audit WordPress user passwords against a dictionary file.

== Description ==

This plugin compares a list of passwords against the user accounts in a WordPress blog, using the password hashing functions built into WordPress. It can be a useful tool for auditing your user's choice of passwords. This plugin uses no functions or data not already available to other plugins, or administrators.

== Installation ==

1. Download and unzip the plugin. Upload the unzipped folder to the wp-contents/plugins folder of your WordPress installation.
2. Enable the plugin from the WordPress Plugins administration page.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I use the plugin? =

1. The password dictionary is stored in 'dictionary.txt' in the plugin's home directory. A small sample dictionary of common passwords is included. The check is run in the background: due to the secure hashing algorithm large dictionaries may take a long time to check. Use the sample dictionary to gauge the performance of a more thorough check.
2. The Password Cracker is found in the Tools Menu. Press the 'Run Cracker' button and the checks will be launched in the background. Use the refresh link to reload the page. The results will be displayed once the check has completed.
